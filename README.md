# CF_Metabolomics

This repository contains computational work related to metabolomics performed on a subset of samples from the Hayden et al. 2020 paper. It also contains code to identify *tnaA* in samples from the [Dartmouth CF](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.02.539134v1), [TEDDY](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0617-x), [DIABIMMUNE](https://diabimmune.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune/), and [Hayden](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31959989/) cohorts.
